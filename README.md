## About this app

This application was built using [ReactJs](https://react.dev/) and TypeScript. [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) was utilized as a dependency for managing routing, and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for efficient state management across the application.

The website allows users to authenticate using a Google account, enabling them to create, read, update, and delete their own posts. This authentication feature is made possible by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Authentication.

For the backend database management, Firebase Realtime Database was used. Operations such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE were performed using the fetch API, all managed by the Redux Toolkit store.

To create the user interface, [Material UI](https://mui.com/) was chosen as a dependency due to its versatility and minimalist style.

The application is fully responsive.
